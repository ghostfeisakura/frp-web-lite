# Lightweight requirements for 2-core 0.5GB RAM servers
# Minimal dependencies to reduce memory footprint

# Core web framework - only essential
Flask==2.3.3

# System monitoring for resource management
psutil==5.9.5

# Note: The following are automatically included with Flask:
# - Werkzeug (WSGI toolkit)
# - Jinja2 (templating)
# - MarkupSafe (string handling)
# - itsdangerous (session security)
# - click (CLI support)
# - blinker (signals)

# Removed dependencies for lightweight deployment:
# - No database drivers (using file-based storage if needed)
# - No additional web servers (using Flask's built-in server)
# - No heavy frameworks or ORMs
# - No unnecessary utilities

# Total estimated memory usage: ~15-25MB for dependencies
